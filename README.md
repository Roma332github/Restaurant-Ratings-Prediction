# Introduction to Restaurant Ratings Prediction Project 🍽️📊
## In the dynamic world , predicting restaurant ratings has become a pivotal application of machine learning (ML). The ability to foresee customer satisfaction not only empowers restaurateurs to enhance service quality but also assists food enthusiasts in making informed dining choices. This project aims to leverage advanced ML techniques to predict restaurant ratings based on a diverse set of featuresbehind great dining experiences!
## Objective 🎯
### The primary objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts restaurant ratings. By analyzing various factors such as cuisine type, location, pricing, customer reviews, and service quality, Let's see the various steps involved in this:
## Data Collection and Preprocessing 🗂️🔄
### The dataset comprises historical data from various restaurant review platforms, including attributes like:

#### 1.) Restaurant ID: Unique identifier for each restaurant.
#### 2.) Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant.
#### 3.) Country Code: Country code where the restaurant is located.
#### 4.) City: City where the restaurant is situated.
#### 5.) Address: Address of the restaurant.
#### 6.) Locality: General locality of the restaurant.
#### 7.) Locality Verbose: Detailed locality description.
#### 8.) Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the restaurant's location.
#### 9.) Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the restaurant's location.
#### 10.) Cuisines: Type of cuisines offered by the restaurant (target variable).
#### 11.) Average Cost for Two: Average cost for two people dining at the restaurant.
#### 12.) Currency: Currency used for pricing.
#### 13.) Has Table Booking: Binary variable indicating if the restaurant accepts table bookings.
#### 14.) Has Online Delivery: Binary variable indicating if the restaurant offers online delivery.
#### 15.) Is Delivering Now: Binary variable indicating if the restaurant is currently delivering.
#### 16.) Switch to Order Menu: Binary variable indicating if the restaurant has an online menu ordering option.
#### 17.) Price Range: Range indicating the price level of the restaurant's menu items.
#### 18.) Aggregate Rating: Average rating of the restaurant based on customer reviews.
#### 19.) Rating Color: Color code representing the rating level.
#### 20.) Rating Text: Textual representation of the rating level.
#### 21.) Votes: Total number of votes received by the restaurant.
### Data preprocessing is crucial to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables. Techniques such as one-hot encoding and normalization will be applied to prepare the dataset for modeling.
## Model Selection and Training 📈🤖
### We will explore several ML algorithms to identify the best-performing model. The candidates include:
#### XGBoost 🧠
#### Random Forests 🌲
#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
#### Linear Regressiont📏
### Each model will be evaluated using cross-validation and metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to ensure reliability and accuracy.
## Evaluation and Optimization 📊🔧
### Post-training, the models will undergo rigorous evaluation. Hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and validation techniques will be employed to optimize performance. The goal is to achieve a model that not only predicts accurately but also generalizes well to new, unseen data.
## Impact and Applications 🌐💡
### Accurate restaurant rating predictions can revolutionize the food industry by:
#### 1.) Enhancing customer experience through personalized recommendations
#### 2.) Assisting restaurant owners in strategic decision-making
#### 3.) Providing insights for marketing and operational improvements
### This project exemplifies the transformative potential of machine learning in everyday applications, paving the way for smarter dining experiences and better business outcomes.
